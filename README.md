## Description

This project was made to highlight the awesomeness that is NoSQL, more specifically MongoDB and Mongoose. Here, we have a simple server setup with express routes and mongoose magic. There is currently no front end.

## Installation


Step 1: Clone this repository

Step 2: Run npm install express sequelize bcrypt mongoose

Step 3: Download MongoDB and follow their instructions, opt out to download MongoDB compass

Step 4: Download/launch your HTTP requester of choice

Step 5: Run npm start to launch the server



## Usage 

First you would load up your favorite HTTP request viewer/tester, I recommend Insomnia Core. Start the server, read over the routes and models and start requesting away!
